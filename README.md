## WEB3 HACKATHON

- This is a website for Web3 Hackathon that entails the program, speakers who will be present and also talks more about the event. It also shows previous events that have happened in different countries. This helped me broaden my understanding in github, githubflows, version control and to demonstrate the ability to submit a project for code review.
